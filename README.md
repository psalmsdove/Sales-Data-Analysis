# Sales Analysis Dashboard

Sales Analysis Dashboard is a web-based data visualization project that aims to provide insights into a retail company's sales data. The main goal of the project is to help the company understand its sales performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve profitability and customer satisfaction.
## Features

- **Interactive Dashboard**: The project includes an **interactive web-based dashboard** that allows users to explore and analyze the sales data visually. Users can interact with different charts and graphs to gain deeper insights into the data.
- **Sales by Category**: The dashboard provides a breakdown of sales across different product categories. It helps the company identify which product categories are performing well and which ones may need improvement.
