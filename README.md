# Sales Analysis Dashboard

Sales Analysis Dashboard is a web-based data visualization project that aims to provide insights into a retail company's sales data. The main goal of the project is to help the company understand its sales performance, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve profitability and customer satisfaction.
## Features
